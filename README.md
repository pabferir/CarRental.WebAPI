### Project Structure and Architecture

</p>

#### Core Project
The Core project is the center of the architecture design as it hosts the Domain layer and doesn't have any external dependency. Web project and Infrastructure project components depend upon it.

#### Shared Kernel Project
The Shared Kernel project hosts all generic non-domain-specific components used across the solution. It could be extracted and referenced as a NuGet dependency.

#### Infrastucture Project
The Infrastructure project hosts both the Data layer and the Business layer. It contains most of the external dependencies. Many of its components rely on the generic components of the Shared Kernel project.

#### Web Project
The Web project is the entry point of the Web API. It consists of a Console Application and hosts the Application Layer. It also contains custom Configuration classes.

#### Test Projects
The Test projects mimic and point to the source projects. Currently, the only existing Test project is the Infrastructure.Test project.
