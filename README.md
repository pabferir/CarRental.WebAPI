# CarRental.WebAPI [![.NET](https://github.com/pabferir/CarRental.WebAPI/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pabferir/CarRental.WebAPI/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml) 
> An ASP.NET Core 6.0 Web API using a Car Rental data model for training in .NET fundamentals and design patterns.

## Data Model

## Solution Design
Design decisions are inspired by Clean Architecture guidelines from [ardalis/CleanArchitecture](https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture).

</p>

#### Core Project
The Core project is the center of the architecture design, as Web project and Infrastructure project components depend upon it. It hosts both the Domain and Business layers.

> Notice the Domain layer hosts `DbContext` instances as some Business components depend upon it.

#### Shared Kernel Project
The Shared Kernel project hosts all generic non-domain-specific components used across the solution. It could be extracted and referenced as a NuGet dependency.

#### Infrastucture Project
The Infrastructure project hosts the Data layer and contains most external dependencies. Its components implement interfaces defined in the Core project.

#### Web Project
The Web project is the entry point of the Web API. It consists of a Console Application and hosts the Application Layer. It also contains custom Configuration classes.

#### Test Projects
The Test projects mimic and point to the source projects. Currently, the only existing Test project is the Core.Test project.
